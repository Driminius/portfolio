Purpose: I created a custom wordpress template for 'Heroes Avenue'

Credit to the following groups, people for helping me design and develop this template

https://www.taniarascia.com/ , had I not discover her articles, i wouldn't know where to start
towards developing a custom wp template. Currently broke, i will buy you a coffee sometime soon!

https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-add-custom-navigation-menus-in-wordpress-3-0-themes/
the documentation here helps implement functions provided by wp

https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/ Not that intuitive of a tutorial but
helps cover most of the implementations and topics to develop a custom wp template

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/ The foundation of creating
responsive design!
